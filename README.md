# Skin-cancer-classification-
I developed an efficient50 model using pictures of real skin cancer types taken from the hospital. I have implemented a model that predicts the type of cancer.

## Getting Started
It takes the data from Kaggle with the command api, downloads it to your directory and performs the unzipping process automatically. If you are not working on google colab, skip these lines.

### Prerequisites Libraries
```
Python 3.x.x
Pandas
Tensorflow
Efficient50
```
### Installing
You need to download the libraries for these projects.
